Chapter 1 I Arrays and Strings

1.1 Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
    What if you cannot use additional data structures?
    
    Hints: #44, # 777, # 732

1.2 Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.
    
    Hints: #7, #84, #722, #737

1.3 URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20:
    You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters,
    and that you are given the "true" length of the string.
    (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)
    
    EXAMPLE
    Input: "Mr John Smith     "
    Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
